# ISRO Map Matching Project

This project implements a map-matching algorithm to align raw GPS data with corresponding road segments on a digital map. Developed during the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), it aims to enhance the accuracy of location-based services.

## Features

- **GPS Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses raw GPS data for analysis.
- **Map Matching Algorithm**: Aligns GPS points with the correct road segments.
- **Visualization**: Displays matched routes on a map for validation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/champagnepaji12/isro-mapmatching.git
   cd isro-mapmatching
